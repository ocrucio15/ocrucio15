### 📚 About Me
Hi, I’m Olsen John Crucio, a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Mindanao. My journey in tech began with a fascination for how things work, and it’s led me to develop a diverse skill set in programming languages like C, Python, Java, and more. I’ve had the opportunity to work on exciting projects, particularly in machine learning and image processing, where I’ve been able to combine logic with creativity to solve complex challenges.

But being a computer engineer is about more than just coding. I’m passionate about understanding how different systems connect and how technology can be designed to be both powerful and accessible. That’s why I’m also diving into web development, data analytics, and cybersecurity—fields that are shaping the future of tech.

What drives me is the desire to create technology that makes a difference. Whether it’s developing a new application, improving a process, or learning something new, I’m always up for a challenge, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me.
